                    <li><p>I went to San Diego more than 3 years ago, in May of 2019. It was a very nice vacation spot.</p></li>
                    <li> <p> San diego is <em>definitely</em> a place I would recommend people to go to for a vacation. This is because San Diego is basically 
                            an equal mixture of city and beach. It is also a very clean big city. All in all, this is one of the top places I would 
                            recommend someone to go. </p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>I went to Ocean City when I was pretty young, about 8 years old. I had a very interesting time there, from walking on the very long boardwalk to being attacked by sea gulls because I was holding fries.  </p></li>
                    <li> <p> I would recommend someone to go to Ocean City if they want a memorable time at the beach. When I went there, my mom and I 
                        were attacked by seagulls when we were returning from the boardwalk bcause we were holding a bucket of fries to eat on the beach. In the end, though it was scary at the time, that is the <strong>most memorable 
                            experience I have ever had at a beach</strong>. Therefore, Ocean City is basically just any other beach, but with some very mean seagulls that can make 
                        it a very different and special beach vacation.  </p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p> I have gone to Myrtle Beach many times in my life since it is my family's go-to beach. I absolutely love coming here, because though I have been here so many times,
                        it never gets old or boring.   </p></li>
                    <li> <p>This is my favorite and go-to beach. The sand is so soft and the waves here are great. The only problem is it is always a very crowded beach. Overall, my favorite beach that one should go to atleast once in their life.    </p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>I went to Seatle about 5 years ago, and it was <em>one of my favorite vacation spots ever</em>. I love the landscape and the feel of the city. The city itself is like a mixture
                    between older style ad modern style. It is also home to the first ever Starbucks, which was ver cool. In addiion to the pretty city skyline, Seattle is 
                home to many moutains, which is very different from other big cities, so it makes th city even prettier. </p></li>
                    <li> <p>This is a spot I would <strong>100% recommend</strong> to anyone who likes both a city and a nature prominent landscape. Overall,
                    the mixture with the city and natural landscape creates a more fun vacation experience because you get a bit of both parts. </p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p> I went to the Universal Studios in Orlando during the winter before Covid hit. When we went to Orlando however, we only went to Universal.</p></li>
                    <li> <p> If you are a fan of either Disney or Universal Studios, this is a spot for you. Orlando is the home to both amusements parks and has a great deal of fun within.  </p></li>
