                You are saved and  by a stag beetle, but are later kicked out by his friends.<br> 
            In the harsh cold of winter you're lucky to be saved by an old field mouse, who is also tending to a wounded swallow whom you befriend.<br>
            The swallow regains his strength and leaves, and you are pushed into marriage with an old mole who you had
            breifly met while staying with the field mouse.
