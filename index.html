        Years ago, a young woman who was wanting a child asked a witch for advice. The witch gave the woman
        a flower and told her to go home and plant it.
        The woman plants the flower, and soon, the flower blooms and you, Thumbelina, have emerged, looking 
        at the beautiful sky above.

        One night, you were carried off by Mrs. Toad while you were sleep. Mrs. Toad wants you to 
        marry her son.
